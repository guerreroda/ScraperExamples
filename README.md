# ScraperExamples

## Description

This is a compilation of Python/R scripts created between 2019 and 2021.
All programs parse through websites or use the API to create datasets.
Most of them have not been edited in years and are only examples.
Websites may have changed, rendering the program useless.
All programs wer done with the purpose to hone my abilities as practice. Thus, lacking in notes and explantions.
